  - "Despite test": people are using it despite (it sucks | its not as good | its frustrating)
  - "T-shirt test": people with no connection are shilling it
  - "Eyebrow test": idea is misunderstood or controversial

  - Convince, then discuss pricing
- Sales partners
  - "Pre-chasm companies have to create a pull-based market — not a push based one — before they can truly engage the benefits of such partners"
