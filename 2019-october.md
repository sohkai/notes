### Replication is bad for decentralized storage

- [Part 1](https://storj.io/blog/2018/11/replication-is-bad-for-decentralized-storage-part-1-erasure-codes-for-fun-and-profit/)
- [Part 2](https://storj.io/blog/2019/01/why-proof-of-replication-is-bad-for-decentralized-storage-part-2-churn-and-burn/)

- Erasure codes provide dramatically better durability for the same replication factor against replication
  - However, the CPU cost of repairing erasure codes is fair higher (you have to reconstruct the full file, find which pieces are missing, and propagate them again)
- "Increasing node churn dramatically decreases file availability and durability. Strategies like erasure coding and replication are means of insulating against the impact of node churn, but without a mechanism to replace the data, file loss is simply a factor of the rate of churn."

### How Superhuman Built an Engine to Find Product/Market Fit

[Article](https://firstround.com/review/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit/)

- Approach to getting to PMF
- Sean Ellis is a boss
  - “How would you feel if you could no longer use the product?” and measure the percent who answer “very disappointed.”
  - The magic number to this question is 40%
  - You start to get directionally correct results around 40 respondents
- "If you only double down on what users love, your product/market fit score won’t increase. If you only address what holds users back, your competition will likely overtake you"

### Tyranny of Structurelessness

[Article](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm)

- There is no such thing as a fully structureless group
  - Structurelessness becomes a way of masking power
  - Implicit structure becomes a way of hiding power; explicit means others know what's going on and how to contribute
- Elites organically form in groups, based on shared beliefs and activities, and create their own tightly-bounded, informal communication channel
  - "Once one knows with whom it is important to check before a decision is made, and whose approval is the stamp of acceptance, one knows who is running things"
  - **For an organization to be effective, these "friendship" traits that commonly form elites have to give in to traits of competence and merit**
  - Formation of elites is not bad; merely inevitable
  - The informal group cannot be compelled to be responsible; it is left to the interests of the individuals
- Tasks can implicitly structure groups
  - If there is no task at hand, people resort to controlling others out of a lack of something better to do
