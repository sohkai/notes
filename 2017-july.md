### The Simple Economics of Machine Intelligence

[Article](https://hbr.org/2016/11/the-simple-economics-of-machine-intelligence)

- **"Technological revolutions tend to involve some important activity becoming cheap, like the cost of communication or finding information"**
- Machine learning makes prediction cheap
    - This increases the value of tasks that complement prediction and decreases the value of substitutes
- Some problems will be reframed as prediction problems
    - E.g. semiconductors made arithmetic cheap, so we started to digitalize everything (e.g. photos)
    - E.g. driving: rather than program exact decisions based on environmental factors, we now ask the computer to **predict what a human would do**
- **Humans activities have five high-level components: data, prediction, judgment, action, and outcomes**
    - Data was made cheap with computers and communications networks (search)
    - Prediction has been made cheap with AI
    - **Human judgment** based on data and predictions will be key

### Master Productivity and Eliminate Noise Using the Eisenhower Matrix

[Article](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2013/04/how-to-work-more-efficiently-the-eisenhower-matrix/)

- "The most urgent decisions are rarely the most important ones." -- Eisenhower
- "Being busy is a form of laziness — lazy thinking and indiscriminate action." -- Tim Ferris
- Four quadrants:
    - **Urgent and important**: do it immediately
    - Urgent but not important: delegate
    - Important but not urgent: decide when to do it
    - Not urgent or important: do it later (or drop it!)
- Distinguish between important and urgent!
- Don't put off important tasks; give them the proper amount of time or you'll likely have to spend even more time on it later
    - Don't put yourself in a position where you'll have to fix problems made by past reactive decision making

    - Follow the flow of ideas: see where ideas came from, and where they'll take us
    - Change: embrace it and improve

[Article](https://theamericanscholar.org/solitude-and-leadership/)

- Don't aim to just keep the ship running, to go along for the ride and make it up the ladder; aim to make a difference and be yourself
- People expect (and reward) conformity; ask why and if that's positive
- Ask your own questions, set your own goals and worthwhile desires
- Moral courage: "the courage to stand up for what you believe"
- "Thinking means concentrating on one thing long enough to develop an idea about it" -- not learning someone else's ideas

- Find our own **reality**; hear your own voice; discover your own path

### Are You Solving the Right Problems?

[Article](https://hbr.org/2017/01/are-you-solving-the-right-problems)

- The hard part is figuring out *which* problems to solve, not *how* to solve them
- Most people struggle with daily problems, not annual strategic ones
- **Reframe** your problems
    - Why is the problem actually happening? What are people complaining about? What are they feeling? Why does it need to be fixed?
    - "The point of reframing is not to find the 'real' problem but, rather, to see if there is a better one to solve"
- Practices:
    1. **Establish legitimacy**: get others accustomed to reframing problems
    1. **Bring outsiders into the discussion**: get their unentrenched perspective
        - Find a *boundary spanner* who is able to speak their mind
        - Ask for inputs, not solutions
    1. **Get people's definitions in writing**: see what people actually think the problem is, and how they frame it
        - We can try to imagine different perspectives, but we often get it wrong
    1. **Ask what's missing**: what is missing from our definition of the problem (or why we think it's happening)?
    1. **Consider multiple categories**: what do we think categorizes the problem? Are there any other categories we haven't considered?
        - Metacognition: thinking about how we think
    1. **Analyze positive exceptions**: what was different when the problem wasn't a problem?
        - This also makes the discussion less threatening and confrontational
    1. **Question the objective**: what do people actually want (their hidden agenda)? Clarify and then challenge.
- "Tools can be the subtlest of traps" -- Neil Gaiman

### Platonically irrational

[Article](https://aeon.co/essays/what-plato-knew-about-behavioural-economics-a-lot)

- "New catchwords hide from us the thoughts and feelings of our ancestors, even when they differed little from our own" -- Bertrand Russel
    - Related to recency bias; we can only affirm and relate to what we know well (more likely recent things)
- Greek philosophers (e.g. Plato) thought about behaviour psychology long before modern science
- Don't mistake relative for absoltue values
- Intellectual humility is both a **moral** and mental trait

### Why Your Brain Hates Other People

[Article](http://nautil.us/issue/49/the-absurd/why-your-brain-hates-other-people)

- Be careful of the automatic association your brain makes between similar Us people vs. who you think are They people; stop to notice and think about if you've made a correct judgement
    - We're always more favored and forgiving towards Us people, and more quick to judge and spiteful toward Thems (confirmation bias)
    - Supposed rationality is often just rationalization (to fool ourselves)
- We're most hostile between envy and disgust
- We're most likely to associate between pride and envy
- Lots of tragedies happen when we transform a group from low warmth and high competence into low warmth and low competence
    - When a group is low warmth and low competence, it's easy to destroy as Us are trained to think they're disgusting
- **Distrust essentialism**, err on individualism

### Periodization: How Cycling Your Goals Helps You Gain New Skills Without Losing the Ones You Have

[Article](https://gmb.io/periodization/)

- Focus training on one specific goal at a time, and then transitioning to another in a planned schedule
- At the end of a schedule, cycle back to the first goal
- Two types:
    - Linear: Break attributes you want to obtain into 4-6 week (or however long) blocks
    - Non-linear: Work on different attributes on different days (i.e. blocks are one day each)
- Attributes are things like agility, endurance, power, etc rather than a specific muscle group
  (think generalized end goal vs. specific physical or knowledge domain)
- **Key is to focus on one specfic thing during a single block of time!**
- Distill your general goals (by asking who and where motivation comes from, specific targets) into specific attributes
- Know where you are now and where you'd like to be
    - Break your end goal down into building blocks and assess where you need the most improvement
- "Priorities are like arms – if you think you have more than two, you’re crazy." – Merlin Mann
