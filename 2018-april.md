### Against Economic Abstraction

[Article](https://medium.com/@Vlad_Zamfir/against-economic-abstraction-e27f4cbba5a7)

- Economic abstraction: blockchain architecture can be modified to remove the existence of a single native blockchain token; potentially any  number could be used
- Proof of stake:
    - Economic abstraction makes calculating economic security more difficult, and increases attack surface on the calculation
- Transaction fees:
    - Validators would have to calculate which fees offered are adequate

### What Makes A Good Engineering Culture

[Article](http://www.effectiveengineer.com/blog/what-makes-a-good-engineering-culture)

- Optimize for iteration speed
    - Barriers to deploying code and features is super frustrating!
    - Leaders need to "commit, explode, recover": commit to a plan, execute, and react to results
- Automate
    - Automation must be driven by data and monitoring
- Build the right abstractions
    - Build the right underlying framework and use the crap out of it
- Do code reviews right. Period.
- Foster a respectful environment
    - People should be comfortable challenging each other
- Shared ownership of code
    - Don't build walls between teams; incentivize going across those walls
- 20% time
    - You can also use it to incentivize people to learn about other parts of the tech stack, by working on it or documenting it

### A quick guide to Stripe's culture

[Article](https://stripe.com/us/jobs/candidate-info?a=1#culture)

- There a still a lot of hard problems with significant impact left. That being said, success is not assured; are you ok with a substantial amount of risk and ambiguity?
- Responsibilities are serious. People are motivated; if you set a high bar, someone will try to push it higher.
    - Give high performers the room to work on the most interesting and high-impact problems
- Seek truth, rather than follow. Follow the facts, from first principles, and allow your mind to be changed.
- The "no asshole" rule is far too low. Overtrust your colleagues.
- Recognize, award, and admire people who contribute to everyone's success (global vs. local); ownership over the whole vs. your share
- Opinionated on what to build, neutral in who gets access to the results.
- Micro pessimists but macro optimists: problems are everywhere, but things will be better in the future, and we will make positive impact

### Engineering culture at Airbnb

[Article](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/engineering-culture-at-airbnb-345797c17cbe)

- Engineers own their impact: everyone is responsible for creating as much value for users and the company as possible
    - Hire problem solvers, and leave decision making up to the individuals (but also help them get the most and best quality information to make decisions with via tools and processes)
    - Engineers define and prioritize impactful work with the rest of their teams
- Default to information sharing
- Helping others takes priority
    - Help your colleagues find leveraged problems to solve
- Goals
    - Create a numeric target, to measure effectiveness against
    - Teams define their own subgoals and projects on a quarterly basis, guided by overall company strategy
- "**We believe in shaping good judgment in individuals instead of imposing rules across the team"**
    - Empower the individual, align them with your overall strategy
- On new processes or tools:
    - Facilitate awareness of the idea or tool, and then let it stand on its own merit. If it .doesn't catch on, it'll organically die
- Values:
    - **Leave it better than you found it**
- Managers are facilitators; get obstacles out of the way (career obstacles, prioritizations, technical help, etc)

### Palantir's Engineering Culture

[Article](https://www.palantir.com/engineering-culture/)

- "You just have to speak up when things aren't right, evaluate ideas on their merits, and build things that fix what's broken"
- "We hire people to have an opinion and be creative"
- "Inventing the future requires detaching yourself from the past"; celebrate your work getting replaced

### Objectives and Key Results

[Article](https://medium.com/startup-tools/okrs-5afdc298bc28)

- Objectives: write out what you hope to accomplish such that later you can easily tell if you have reached, or have a clear path to reaching, that objective
- Key results: numerically-based expressions of success towards an objective
    - Its up to individual contributors to figure out how to get to these metrics
    - Make these flexible enough to allow for a number of creative solutions
- **OKRs are a communication framework!**
