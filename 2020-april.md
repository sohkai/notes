  - Message passing (decoupling)
  - Encapsulation (avoiding shared mutable state)
  - Dynamic binding
- Non-essential:
  - Classes, inheritance, polymorphism
  - Typing

### On Non-Violent Communication

[Article](https://medium.com/@eriktorenberg_/on-nonviolent-communication-33ca8c7ebfcb)

- Language framework for taking responsibility for our own thoughts, actions, and feelings:
  - Observation: specific facts/data, no evaluation/judgment
  - Feeling: state how we feel
  - Need: the need underlying this feeling
  - Request: must be specific action to address need
- Example: “When <observation>, I feel <feeling>, because I am needing <need>. Therefore, I would now like <request>.”
- Others may not use this framework, but observe it in them! They all express needs hidden in a judgement or demand.
- Don't focus on being right, focus on the others' unmet needs
- Clarify between needs and strategies (actions)
- Anger is an alarm clock for unmet needs
- "The basis of violence is when people are in pain and don’t know how to say that clearly"
- Avoid motivating by guilt (confuses needs and feelings) or "should" (gives you a way out)
- Apologizing vs. mourning: apologize is "should feel bad", mourn is to recognize an internal unmet need out of our own actions
