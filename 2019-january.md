### Secure Interaction Design and the Principle of Least Authority

[Paper](http://zesty.ca/pubs/yee-sid-chi2003-workshop.pdf)

- Design principles:
  1. *Path of Least Resistance*: The most natural way to do any task should also be the most secure way.
  2. *Appropriate Boundaries*: The interface should expose, and the system should enforce, distinctions between objects and between actions along boundaries that matter to the user.
  3. *Explicit Authorization*: A user’s authorities must only be provided to other actors as a result of an explicit user action that is understood to imply granting.
  4. *Visibility*: The interface should allow the user to easily review any active actors and authority relationships that would affect security-relevant decisions.
  5. *Revocability*: The interface should allow the user to easily revoke authorities that the user has granted, wherever revocation is possible.
  6. *Expected Ability*: The interface must not give the user the impression that it is possible to do something that cannot actually be done.
  7. *Trusted Path*: The interface must provide an unspoofable and faithful communication channel between the user and any entity trusted to manipulate authorities on the user’s behalf.
  8. *Identifiability*: The interface should enforce that distinct objects and distinct actions have unspoofably identifiable and distinguishable representations.
  9. *Expressiveness*: The interface should provide enough expressive power (a) to describe a safe security policy without undue difficulty; and (b) to allow users to express security policies in terms that fit their goals.
  10. *Clarity*: The effect of any security-relevant action must be clearly apparent to the user before the action is taken.

### Enter the Crypto Idea Maze

[Article](https://jonchoi.com/cryptoideamaze/)

- Theses:
  - *Sound money*: “Trustless money” that cannot be inflated by any trusted authority such as a central bank.
  - *Web3*: “Trustless internet” where Internet architecture is free of trusted centralized data & service monopolies. Users have more control over their data and Internet usage. These networks also compensate participants for economic value generated in the network.
  - *Open finance*: “Trustless financial systems” that extend cryptocurrency to provide open software primitives for equities, debt, derivatives, checking accounts, remittances, work contracts, retirement accounts, property etc.
- Features are not inherently valuable; they're only useful in the context of a user need
  - Each of the theses have their own, diverging users
  - What does success for a product / feature mean?
  - What is its next best alternative? And how much worse is this alternative?
  - If critical mass is necessary, is there any value before reaching that point?
- Ethos-requiring products will only get so far without a compelling case for ethos-neutral people (i.e. most people)
