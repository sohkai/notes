### No Kings: How Do You Make Good Decisions Efficiently in a Flat Organization?

[Article](https://doist.com/blog/decision-making-flat-organization/)

- Too much input results in being overwhelmed; work towards rough consensus instead
  - "Engineering always involves a set of tradeoffs. It is almost certain that any time engineering choices need to be made, there will be options that appeal to some people, but are not appealing to some others."
  - Take temperature of the room by humming instead of explicitly voting
  - Make the distinction between "not the best choice" (loose disagreement) vs. fundamental flaws (disqualifying disagreement)
    - Don't slow down the process due to loose disagreement
    - Have a shared understanding of what "fundamentally flawed" looks like for a particular decision
  - Conceding is not compromise
  - Rule of thumb: if it's not worth committing to over-communicate a point, it's probably unnecessary feedback
- Ask people if "can you live with this?" rather than "do you agree with this?"
