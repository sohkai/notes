### A Peek Inside the Moonshot Factory Operating Manual

[Article](https://blog.x.company/a-peek-inside-the-moonshot-factory-operating-manual-f5c33c9ab4d7)

- An X project must:
  - Solve a problem that affects millions or billions of people
  - Have an audacious, sci-fi sounding technology
  - There has to be at least a glimmer of hope that it’s actually achievable in the next 5–10 years
- **Responsibly irresponsible**
  - Identify risks early, learn cheaply, and be brutally honest what's working and what's not
- **Fall in love with the problem, not the solution** (e.g. a technology)
  - Find "T-shaped" people who are intellectually flexible but have deep domain expertise
  - Centralized "design kitchen" of flexible staff that help independent teams on specific areas (e.g. hardware prototyping)
- **Moving through the factory**
  1. Rapid evaluation: find the breakthroughs that might offer the core ingredients needed
    - Understand the biggest risks
    - Build prototypes around the hardest and riskiest areas to understand the problem (while also satisfying economic requirements)
    - Find out with more certainty if an idea can survive comfortably (and make money) in the real world
- **Actively killing ideas**
  - Kill fast, make it psychologically safe to walk away when something's not working
  - Assume failure is the norm
  - Progress based on risk factor (progress only counts if it's towards the riskiest aspects)
  - Have planned kill switches
