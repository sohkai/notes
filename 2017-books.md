### Ethereum

Author: Henning Diedrich

- "Blockchains collapse agreement and execution [with smart contracts]"
- "Blockchains are about guarantee of execution"
- "Ethereum programs cannot be stopped"
- "Decentralization pre-empts outside control"
- "Blockchains prevent things from going wrong in the first place"
- "With blockchains, programs take on a life of their own"
- "Who doesn't agree is simply kicked off the network"
- "Because everything is signed, there is no need to trust"
- "A blockchain survives as long as one node stays up"
- "The ultimate arbiter for blockchains is social consensus [on what to value and how to value]"
- "If it doesn't use guaranteed execution, it's not a blockchain use case"
- "Blockchains allow for bearer-like, yet auditable instruments"
- "Blockchains add the dimension of trust to data"
- "A blockchain protects the accounts [and what's in them] when a node is compromised"
- "Total validation replaces central control [but this is slower]"
- "All accounts 'pre-exist.' You just grab a random key for one."
- "Blockchains substitute for trust"
- "Blockchains replace intermediaries with mathematics"
- "Blockchains introduce digital scarcity"
- "Proof-of-work incentivizes consensus instead of enforcing it"
- "Decentralized code cannot be altered or shut down"
- "Smart contracts dis-intermediate the intermediaries"
- "Smart contracts allow for new markets by forcing honesty [in markets which were previously too small to control]"
- "A blockchain transfer is very fast to finality [as opposed to verification that the payment occurred which most systems excel at today]"
- "Blockchains commit state very slowly"
- "Ethereum is a chain for everyone, hardened for public exposure, designed for interoperability and openness first"

### Ã˜MQ - The Guide

[Book](http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#toc0)

Author: Pieter Hintjens

- Programming is science dressed as art
    - "The science of programming: make building blocks that people can understand and use easily, and people will work together to solve the very largest problems"
- New software crisis (is it still one?): creating connected applications is incredibly costly (and centralized)
    - To fix the world, with *science*: solve how to connect code, and give the solution to people in the simplest way possible
- "Classy programmers share the same motto as classy hit men: always clean-up when you finish the job"
- "Software dies, but community survives"
    - Large-scale and long-lasting software usually goes hand-in-hand with a flourishing free software community behind it
    - **"Software is about people"**
- Software architecture:
    - "How we organize is more significant than who we are" --> processes, coordination
    - We're bad at understanding complexity, but good at working together to divide and conquer large problems
    - Psychology:
        - Stupidity: we're all stupid at some point; simplicity beats functionality
        - Selfishness: we're all selfish, so the architecture has to leave room for people to express their selfish acts
        - Laziness: we make lots of assumptions, and most of them are wrong; test these early and cheaply
        - Jealousy: we're competitive and like to prove others wrong; the architecture should provide space for open competition (to get the best result)
        - Fear: we're afraid of being embarrassed and failing; the architecture should be easy and cheap to silently experiment
        - Reciprocity: rules should enforce how people work together, and what to avoid
        - Conformity: establish clear, documented, and efforced patterns and you'll get people following them
        - Pride: allow attritibution, as we're all silent egoists
        - Greed: value must flow to all producers, either that be reputation, money, etc; think of the architecture as a economic marketplace
- Collective works usually have two outcomes:
    1. Failure, at which point everyone stops caring, or
    1. Success, at which point everyone vies for control and power
- (Worth trying) providing upfront terms of conflict settlement makes conflict less likely
- Projects with GPL licenses are allowed to fork and re-merge, whereas BSD (including MIT, Apache, etc) do not allow re-merging, potentially killing projects that have fall-outs
    - BSD licenses were meant to be non-profitable and leaky, given to the masses at under cost for adoption
    - "The license we choose modifies the economics of those who use our work"
    - Closed source makes people see you as an enemy, BSD makes them see you as a free lunch, and GPL as allies (if they try to run off with it, you can always remerge theirs into your original project)
    - Interesting views on the Github fork/PR model with GPL
        - Allow others to become owners and be empowered that way
        - Forks allow for experimentation and competition; branches give too much power to maintainers and are more complex to manage
- Community needs:
    - Symbolic leadership for easy, authoritative conflict resolution (or forking)
    - Rules and processes that are enforced
    - Financial backing
    - A market to connect experts with customers for support, integration, etc.
- **"Going fast in the wrong direction is not just useless, it's actively damaging"**
- Development:
    - Identify problems and then make minimal, accurate solutions to these problems
    - Publicly explain the problem, why it's a problem, and how to solve it, giving others the chance to review and correct
- Patents and ideas: you shouldn't be able to "own" an idea, only the manifestation of one (the real work put into giving life to an idea)
- **"You need a goal that's crazy and simple enough to get people out of bed in the morning"**
- Transparency -> trust -> scale
- Interesting views on innovation:
    - No lone geniuses, but continual acceptance of good solutions crowd sourced and disposal of bad ones (market competition)
    - Individual creativity matters less than process
    - Processes should be able to replace road maps, given competition favours better solutions
    - Solutions are discovered, not invented
    - Intelligence is social, even if it feels individual
    - Size and diversity of the community speed up processes for discovering problems and solutions
- Design processes:
    - Trash-oriented design: prioritize Brilliant Ideas, create grand designs irrespective of actual problems, work the engineers, and agressively market
    - Complexity-oriented design: high cost means more value, so increasingly complicated architectures and features are taken for granted to provide more value (despite usually decreasing value)
        - Obsessively solving the wrong problem in collective delusion
        - **Instead of asking "What if someone wants to do X?", ask "What is the real value of solving Y?"**
        - If you make stuff nobody asks for, you're probably wasting your time (although I'd say it depends on if you have a **vision** for what you're doing rather than technical masturbation)
        - Solving simple problems usually is more valuable than solving really hard ones -> engineers like to focus on the most interesting but least worthwhile
    - Simplicity-oriented design: end result is fluid through rapid, incremental stages of work, starting from an evaluation of a set of interesting problems for their worths and solving the most important, at any given time, with a brutally minimal solution (Minimal Plausible Patch)
        - Always ask: "Can it be done simpler?"
        - Judge simplicity by the number or difficulty of concepts someone new needs to learn (or guess)
        - **"Design is about removing friction in the use of a product"**; good designers notice annoyances and thinks about how to smooth them
- My default state is likely best described as a "Canary Watcher": watch for pain, figure out why, and make it better; "people should feel joy in their work"
- On Sun Tzu quotes: " It's hard to be angry at a Chinese general, especially when he has been dead for 2,400 years."
- **"*Do not invent concepts.* The job of a designer is to remove problems, not add features."**
- On using code generators for model generation:
    - Use it only where you would otherwise be writing tiresome code by hand.
    - Design natural models that are what people would expect to see.
    - Write the code by hand first so you know what to generate.
    - Do not overuse. Keep it simple! *Do not get too meta!!*
    - Introduce gradually into a project.
    - Put the generated code into your repositories.
- "There's a joke about UDP but sometimes you'll get it, and sometimes you won't." :laughing:
- "Some cultures teach us to aspire to perfection and punish mistakes in education and work, which makes this attitude [avoiding failure] worse. To accept that we're fallible, and then to learn how to turn that into profit rather than shame is one of the hardest intellectual exercises in any profession."
