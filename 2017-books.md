### Ã˜MQ - The Guide

[Book](http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#toc0)

Author: Pieter Hintjens

- Programming is science dressed as art
    - "The science of programming: make building blocks that people can understand and use easily, and people will work together to solve the very largest problems"
- New software crisis (is it still one?): creating connected applications is incredibly costly (and centralized)
    - To fix the world, with *science*: solve how to connect code, and give the solution to people in the simplest way possible
- "Classy programmers share the same motto as classy hit men: always clean-up when you finish the job"
- "Software dies, but community survives"
    - Large-scale and long-lasting software usually goes hand-in-hand with a flourishing free software community behind it
    - **"Software is about people"**
- Software architecture:
    - "How we organize is more significant than who we are" --> processes, coordination
    - We're bad at understanding complexity, but good at working together to divide and conquer large problems
    - Psychology:
        - Stupidity: we're all stupid at some point; simplicity beats functionality
        - Selfishness: we're all selfish, so the architecture has to leave room for people to express their selfish acts
        - Laziness: we make lots of assumptions, and most of them are wrong; test these early and cheaply
        - Jealousy: we're competitive and like to prove others wrong; the architecture should provide space for open competition (to get the best result)
        - Fear: we're afraid of being embarrassed and failing; the architecture should be easy and cheap to silently experiment
        - Reciprocity: rules should enforce how people work together, and what to avoid
        - Conformity: establish clear, documented, and efforced patterns and you'll get people following them
        - Pride: allow attritibution, as we're all silent egoists
        - Greed: value must flow to all producers, either that be reputation, money, etc; think of the architecture as a economic marketplace
- Collective works usually have two outcomes:
    1. Failure, at which point everyone stops caring, or
    1. Success, at which point everyone vies for control and power
- (Worth trying) providing upfront terms of conflict settlement makes conflict less likely
- Projects with GPL licenses are allowed to fork and re-merge, whereas BSD (including MIT, Apache, etc) do not allow re-merging, potentially killing projects that have fall-outs
    - BSD licenses were meant to be non-profitable and leaky, given to the masses at under cost for adoption
    - "The license we choose modifies the economics of those who use our work"
    - Closed source makes people see you as an enemy, BSD makes them see you as a free lunch, and GPL as allies (if they try to run off with it, you can always remerge theirs into your original project)
    - Interesting views on the Github fork/PR model with GPL
        - Allow others to become owners and be empowered that way
        - Forks allow for experimentation and competition; branches give too much power to maintainers and are more complex to manage
- Community needs:
    - Symbolic leadership for easy, authoritative conflict resolution (or forking)
    - Rules and processes that are enforced
    - Financial backing
    - A market to connect experts with customers for support, integration, etc.
- **"Going fast in the wrong direction is not just useless, it's actively damaging"**
- Development:
    - Identify problems and then make minimal, accurate solutions to these problems
    - Publicly explain the problem, why it's a problem, and how to solve it, giving others the chance to review and correct
- Patents and ideas: you shouldn't be able to "own" an idea, only the manifestation of one (the real work put into giving life to an idea)
- **"You need a goal that's crazy and simple enough to get people out of bed in the morning"**
- Transparency -> trust -> scale
- Interesting views on innovation:
    - No lone geniuses, but continual acceptance of good solutions crowd sourced and disposal of bad ones (market competition)
    - Individual creativity matters less than process
    - Processes should be able to replace road maps, given competition favours better solutions
    - Solutions are discovered, not invented
    - Intelligence is social, even if it feels individual
    - Size and diversity of the community speed up processes for discovering problems and solutions
- Design processes:
    - Trash-oriented design: prioritize Brilliant Ideas, create grand designs irrespective of actual problems, work the engineers, and agressively market
    - Complexity-oriented design: high cost means more value, so increasingly complicated architectures and features are taken for granted to provide more value (despite usually decreasing value)
        - Obsessively solving the wrong problem in collective delusion
        - **Instead of asking "What if someone wants to do X?", ask "What is the real value of solving Y?"**
        - If you make stuff nobody asks for, you're probably wasting your time (although I'd say it depends on if you have a **vision** for what you're doing rather than technical masturbation)
        - Solving simple problems usually is more valuable than solving really hard ones -> engineers like to focus on the most interesting but least worthwhile
    - Simplicity-oriented design: end result is fluid through rapid, incremental stages of work, starting from an evaluation of a set of interesting problems for their worths and solving the most important, at any given time, with a brutally minimal solution (Minimal Plausible Patch)
        - Always ask: "Can it be done simpler?"
        - Judge simplicity by the number or difficulty of concepts someone new needs to learn (or guess)
        - **"Design is about removing friction in the use of a product"**; good designers notice annoyances and thinks about how to smooth them
- My default state is likely best described as a "Canary Watcher": watch for pain, figure out why, and make it better; "people should feel joy in their work"
- On Sun Tzu quotes: " It's hard to be angry at a Chinese general, especially when he has been dead for 2,400 years."
- **"*Do not invent concepts.* The job of a designer is to remove problems, not add features."**
- On using code generators for model generation:
    - Use it only where you would otherwise be writing tiresome code by hand.
    - Design natural models that are what people would expect to see.
    - Write the code by hand first so you know what to generate.
    - Do not overuse. Keep it simple! *Do not get too meta!!*
    - Introduce gradually into a project.
    - Put the generated code into your repositories.
- "There's a joke about UDP but sometimes you'll get it, and sometimes you won't." :laughing:
- "Some cultures teach us to aspire to perfection and punish mistakes in education and work, which makes this attitude [avoiding failure] worse. To accept that we're fallible, and then to learn how to turn that into profit rather than shame is one of the hardest intellectual exercises in any profession."

### How to Read a Book

Author: Mortimer J. Adler, Charles Van Doren

1. The Activity and Art of Reading
    - Knowledge is a prerequisite to understanding, but we do not need to know *everything* to understand something
    - Modern media (e.g. TV) are designed to make thinking seem unnecessary (**not true!**)
        - Zombie play-back state of opinions in people vs. critical thinking
    - The more active the reading, the better (i.e. more thinking and analysis; see later)
        - Receiving communication is not entirely passive; writers and readers work together to send and receive information
    - Note the difference between reading for *information* vs reading for *understanding*
        - *What* vs. *why*, *how*, meaning, and relations to other information
    - If you understand everything in the book perfectly from the start, you might have only gained *information*
    - Going to work on a book: work from a state of less understanding to one of greater understanding using only your own mind
    - Understanding: new perspectives or intelligence that casts new light on all information related
    - *Widely read* vs *well read*
    - Learning via *instruction* (aided discovery) vs *discovery*; reading is former but exercises same skills as latter
        - Learning via an absent teacher
1. The Levels of Reading
    - Levels:
        1. Elementary: illiterate to literate
        1. Inspectional: reading with time bound; get the most out from a time bound; examine the surface of a text
        1. Analytical: best, most thorough reading you can complete given unlimited time
        1. Syntopical: understanding common themes and topics from multiple sources
    - If you don't inspect a book, you have to build both a superficial knowledge of the book as well as an understanding *at the same time*
1. Elementary Reading
    - First have to master elementary reading before being able to read on higher levels
1. Inspectional Reading
    - Systematic skimming
        - Discover whether the book should be read, and at which level
        - Look at:
            - Title page and preface
            - Table of contents
            - Index
            - Publisher's blurb
            - Chapters that seem pivotal to main points, and their opening and closing summaries (if any)
            - Dip in and out for a few paragraphs and pages, and epilogue (if one)
    - Superficial reading
        - In reading a difficult book, do a superficial reading first; go through without stopping to look up or ponder on ideas you don't understand
        - You'll grasp it much better on a second reading
        - Getting distracted by too many things detracts from the *whole* picture and understanding
            - *Don't miss the forest for the trees!*
    - If you speed read, you should also know *what* to speed read and what to spend time on
        - Not all books are equal; nor should they be read equally
        - Not all parts in a book are equal as well
        - Know which parts should be read slowly for proper comprehension
    - Know what to look for (and what you're looking for), and when you've found it
    - Speed reading is reading at the speed of your mind, rather than your eyes (mental vs physical)
    - "Every book should be read no more slowly than it deserves, and no more quickly than you can read it with satisfaction and comprehension"
1. Inspectional Reading 2
    - Be a demanding reader, keep your mind on the goal: understanding and growing from reading
    - Ask questions while you read, and try to answer them as you read (make it a habit!)
        - Creating understanding from a book means asking yourself questions as you read
        - Ask no questions = get no answers
    - **Questions for active reading**:
        1. What is the book about, as a whole?
        1. What is being said in detail, and how?
        1. Is the book true, whole or part? (Needs first two; make your own decision, not just the author's)
        1. What of it (new understanding)? Why is it important, what follows, is suggested, etc?
    - Need both the will and the skill to demand more from reading, otherwise it'll just be frustrating
    - "Elevate yourself by mastering what at first sight seems to be beyond you"
    - Write answers in the book as you read
    - Thinking tends to express itself in words
    - "Reading a book should be a conversation between you and the author"
    - Try to summarize and outline the author's points
    - First, take notes of the *structure* of a book:
        - What type is it, what of it, and how is it structured?
    - Then, take *conceptual* notes:
        - What are the truths? What of them?
    - When reading syntopically, you can takes *dialectal* notes (see Part 4): a communal discussion taken by all the authors
    - Art and skill are formed by operating in accordance to rules
1. Pigeonholing a Book
    - **Rule 1**: You must know what type of book you're reading, and should know this as early as possible
        - Sometimes this can be hard to tell apart (e.g. fiction from nonfiction)
    - You can (and should try to!) infer a lot from just a book's title
    - Know not only the grouping, but what the grouping means (and how it differs against other groupings)
    - Practical vs. theoretical
        - Practical: what works, and how
        - Theoretical: something to be seen and understood
        - Knowledge vs application (that vs how)
        - Fact (truth) vs judging, giving opinions, and persuading
    - Theoretical:
        - History: specific events in a single time and space
        - Science: laws of generalizations
        - Philosophy: similar to science, but falling into daily, routine experiences (armchair thinking)
    - Different types of books (and authors) will frame arguments and facts differently
        - We should read them differently as well
1. X-raying a Book
    - "Every book has a skeleton hidden between its covers." -- your job is to find it
    - **Rule 2**: State the unity (theme) of a whole book in a single sentence, or at most a paragraph
        - What is the author up to; what is he trying to do?
        - "Feeling" it is not good enough; state it!
        - Only you can formulate the unity of a book for yourself; take the author's hints and help, but do not rely on them
    - **Rule 3**: Set forth the major parts of the book, and show how these are organized into a whole, by being ordered to one another and to the unity of the whole
        - The author is architecting the structure of the book, and unifying many independent ideas into a whole
        - "Unless you grasp the organization of its parts, you cannot know the whole comprehensively"
        - Make your own outline based on your own understandings and groupings; you do not have to follow what the author has given you (e.g. chapters)
    - **Rule 4**: Find out what the author's problems were
        - What did the author question himself (which are primary and secondary? which are priorities?) when he began the book? What did he want to answer?
        - Theoretical questions:
            - Does something exist?
            - What kind of thing is it?
            - What caused it to exist, or under what conditions can it exist, or why does it exist?
			- What purpose does it serve?
			- What are the consequences of its existence?
			- What are its characteristic properties, its typical traits?
			- What are its relations to other things of a similar sort, or of a different sort?
			- How does it behave?
        - Practical questions:
			- What ends should be sought?
			- What means should be chosen to a given end?
			- What things must one do to gain a certain objective, and in what order?
			- Under these conditions, what is the right thing to do, or the better rather than the worse?
			- Under what conditions would it be better to do this rather than that?
    - Understanding the organization of a book is the effort of understanding how and why you've come to the theme of a book
    - "The best books are those that have the most intelligible structure."
    - "To recognize [plot tropes] is to learn what it means to say that there are only a small number of plots in the world"
        - Difference between good and bad plots, then, is how the author dresses it up
    - "Most readers cannot read outlines" ;)
    - **Writing guideline**: "A piece of writing should have unity, clarity, and coherence"
1. Coming to Terms with an Author
    - Ideal towards both writer and reader: unambiguous conversation
    - **Rule 5**: Find the important words and through them come to terms with the author (understand the same meaning he is trying to convey)
    - Interpret language, and look beyond it to the ideals behind words
        - Words can have many different contextual meanings; it's important to grasp which ones the author places importance on (in which context), and why
        - The most important words are likely those that give you trouble, that make it difficult to understand what the author is talking about otherwise
        - The author may give you help by defining, or stressing certain words
        - Look for each field's technical vocabulary
        - Don't be a non-active reader!
        - Find out if the word is meant to have one or many meanings, what the relations between the meanings is, and why the author switches them
    - Note that words can have multiple meanings, but that multiple words may have the same meaning (synonyms)
1. Determining an Authorâ€™s Message
    - An author declares his judgement about something through his words; a declaration of knowledge
        - These are just personal opinions unless they are supported (and even then, those justifications may be personal)
    - An argument is always a set of statements stating the argument and its supporting rationale
    - Interpreting moves upwards; it goes from words, to terms, to phrases, to prepositions, to paragraphs, etc.
        - Outlining and interpretation meet at the level of prepositions and arguments
    - Notice the difference between a *grammatical* unit of language (sentence, paragraph) versus a *logical* unit (preposition and argument)
    - Break down complex sentences into their major ideas so that you can discern what's being conveyed and what to judge
    - "So long as words, sentences, and paragraphs are opaque and unanalyzed, they are a barrier to, rather than a medium of, communication. **You will read words but not receive knowledge.**"
    - **Rule 6**: Mark the most important sentences in a book and discover the propositions they contain
        - Similar to words, those that require an effort of interpretation are likely to be important
            - You are likely to have the most difficulty with the most important concepts
        - Important words often lead to important propositions
        - They must be premises or conclusions related to the main theme of the book
        - **"The heart of [the author's] communication lies in the major affirmations and denials he is making, and the reasons he gives for so doing"**
        - If you treat everything as the same, read at the same speed and care, "that usually means [to you] that everything is equally unimportant"
            - Pause for the sentences that *puzzle* you, not the ones that *interest* you
        - State propositions made in your own words
            - Don't mistake *thought* or *knowledge* for *words*
        - Find examples in your own life (or imagine them) that are related to the propositions made
            - **Propositions relate to the actual world we live in**
    - **Rule 7**: Locate or construct the basic arguments in the book by finding them in the connection of sentences
        - Search through paragraphs or larger grammatical constructs to find sentences to piece together an argument
        - **"If the book contains arguments, you must know what they are"**
        - Discriminate between inductive and deductive logic
        - Find the underlying assumptions for the argument
    - **Rule 8**: Find out what the authorâ€™s solutions are
        - Are there any he failed to solve? Does the author acknowledge them?
    - Don't mistake the author's world for his ideas; look through the (perhaps outdated) world to what he wants to express
1. Criticizing a Book Fairly
