### Ethereum

Author: Henning Diedrich

- "Blockchains collapse agreement and execution [with smart contracts]"
- "Blockchains are about guarantee of execution"
- "Ethereum programs cannot be stopped"
- "Decentralization pre-empts outside control"
- "Blockchains prevent things from going wrong in the first place"
- "With blockchains, programs take on a life of their own"
- "Who doesn't agree is simply kicked off the network"
- "Because everything is signed, there is no need to trust"
- "A blockchain survives as long as one node stays up"
- "The ultimate arbiter for blockchains is social consensus [on what to value and how to value]"
- "If it doesn't use guaranteed execution, it's not a blockchain use case"
- "Blockchains allow for bearer-like, yet auditable instruments"
- "Blockchains add the dimension of trust to data"
- "A blockchain protects the accounts [and what's in them] when a node is compromised"
- "Total validation replaces central control [but this is slower]"
- "All accounts 'pre-exist.' You just grab a random key for one."
- "Blockchains substitute for trust"
- "Blockchains replace intermediaries with mathematics"
- "Blockchains introduce digital scarcity"
- "Proof-of-work incentivizes consensus instead of enforcing it"
- "Decentralized code cannot be altered or shut down"
- "Smart contracts dis-intermediate the intermediaries"
- "Smart contracts allow for new markets by forcing honesty [in markets which were previously too small to control]"
- "A blockchain transfer is very fast to finality [as opposed to verification that the payment occurred which most systems excel at today]"
- "Blockchains commit state very slowly"
- "Ethereum is a chain for everyone, hardened for public exposure, designed for interoperability and openness first"
