### Feedback is not a evil word

[Article](https://blog.alexmaccaw.com/feedback-is-not-a-dirty-word)

- "You are not objective enough about yourself to grow effectively without external feedback"
- **Effective criticism**
  - Given in private
  - Given when the receiver expects it
  - Comes from a genuine place
  - Is specific and avoids sweeping statements
  - Is in a nonviolet communication format
    - Feedback triggers anger and fear; the art is to avoid provoking these emotions
    - Phrasing: “When you do *specific action*, I feel *emotion* because the story in my head is *your fear*”
      - Specific action should be observable and recordable
      - Emotion is a core emotion, like anger, sadness, disappointment, fear
    - Example: " When you didn’t write any tests for that pull-request you submitted last week, I feel fear because the story in my head is that you don’t place enough value on testing, and that without tests we will introduce bugs that will upset customers, affect revenue, and ultimately destroy our chances of creating a successful company."
- Receiving feedback
  - Avoid fight-or-flight responses; your ego is not being destroyed!
  - View feedback as a gift
  - Repeat given feedback to make sure you've gotten it right, and that the other person knows you've heard them
  - Make sure to track feedback and commit to improving it!
- Be vulnerable; if you can, make the feedback public
