### Today's Crypto Asset Valuation Frameworks

[Article](https://blockchainatberkeley.blog/todays-crypto-asset-valuation-frameworks-573a38eda27e)

- Currency features: store of value, medium of exchange, unit of account
- Store of Value
    - Ecosystem's acceptance / collective belief is foundational to a currency's position as a store of value
- Token Velocity
    - Basically MV=PQ
    - Hodling => higher price
    - Asset design could incentivize hodling, e.g. staking
    - Hard to measure all variables, when velocity changes, hard to determine which of M, P, or Q to record corresponding change
- INET, Crypto J-curve
    - Current utility value + discounted expected utility value, using MV=PQ to calculate price
    - M calculated as value of on-chain transaction value (PQ/V), aka network GDP
- Network Value-to-Transaction Ratio (NVT)
    - NVT = network value / daily tx volume
    - Similar to P/E
    - Volume represents utility users derive from network
- Daily active addresses/users
    - Similar to daily active users
