### Scaling Engineering Organizations

[Article](https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/scaling-eng)

- Continuously iterate and evolve processes to your needs, **not** your users' needs
- Recruiting and hiring:
  - Recruit consistently
  - Make sure to leave a good impression and have examples for different levels of proficiency
  - Test only a single critical skill in each interview
- Culture:
  - Psychological safety to take risks and share beliefs
- Engagement:
  - Employee happiness often rests on knowing impact of work and autonomy in decisions
  - Keep tabs on engagement; people often don't manifest concerns about their engagement externally
  - Help employees discover new opportunities within the organization
  - Ask for feedback quarterly about what could be improved in the organization and their scope of work
