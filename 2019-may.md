### Creating Animations and Interactions with Physical Models

[Article](https://iamralpht.github.io/physics/)

- Maintain the sense of physics via momentum and "virtual" friction
  - Makes interactions feel more natural (we intuitively understand the conservation of momentum)
- Spring values:
  - Spring constant: affects the speed of the feedback (tension?)
  - Damping: affects the size of the feedback (force?)
- You can slow things down with constant deceleration, or friction
- Humans are great at tracking linear motion, but terrible at tracking zoom
  - Avoid linear translations if the performance is bad!

### Kubernetes monitoring with Prometheus in 15 minutes

[Article](https://itnext.io/kubernetes-monitoring-with-prometheus-in-15-minutes-8e54d1de2e13)

- Kubernetes Operator: an application-specific controller that extends the Kubernetes API to create, configure, and manage instances of complex stateful applications on behalf of a Kubernetes user
- Prometheus Operator provides easy monitoring for k8s services and deployments besides managing Prometheus, Alertmanager and Grafana configuration.
- ServiceMonitor
  - A [Custom Resource Definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/api-extension/custom-resources/)
  - Abstract how services are targetted by Prometheus, by defining custom rules (e.g. matching a label)
- AlertManager
  - Handle incoming alerts (dedupe, group, etc.) and send them to receivers

### A Big Little Idea Called Legibility

[Article](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/)

- A repeated pattern of failure by being fooled by your subjective lack of comprehension (of a complex system) into making false simplifications, attempting to maximize "legibility"
  - Maximizing "organization"
  - E.g. applied to states trying to simplify taxation, control, identity, etc.
  - What gets measured gets maximized
- Real societies look random, but are actually pseudorandom (e.g. random number vs. digits in pi)
- Sometimes replacing locally optimal solutions with globally optimal ones (e.g. standardization of time)
  - Engineering a shift in optima and power

### Eight Metaphors of Organization

[Article](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/13/the-eight-metaphors-of-organization/)

- The organization as:
  - Machine
  - Organism
  - Brain
  - Culture
  - Political system
  - Psychic prison
  - System of change and flux
  - Instrument of domination

### Aggregation Theory

[Article](https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/)

- Aggregation Theory: describes how platforms (i.e. aggregators) come to dominate the industries in which they compete in a systematic and predictable way
- Value chain: supplier, distributor, consumer/user
  - Outsized profits:
    - Horizontally integrate in one segment
    - Vertically integrate between two to gain UX advantage
- Before internet, control depended on controlling the distributor
  - Most integrated backwards into supply rather than forward into consumers: costly individual transactions means that controlling the smaller (and less chaotic) segment provides more leverage
- With internet, distribution is free, supply has grown, transaction costs minimized
  - Allows companies to focus on the consumers with UX, and the supply will be attracted to those who have the most scale

### Defining Aggregators

[Article](https://stratechery.com/2017/defining-aggregators/)

- Must have three characteristics:
  - Direct relationship with customers
  - Zero marginal costs for additional customer
  - Demand driven networks with decreasing acquisition costs (e.g. network effects)
    - Abundance in supply; most value comes at discovery and curation
    - Suppliers are drawn by more users; users are draw by more suppliers

### How to build a successful movement in 4 steps

[Article](https://ideas.ted.com/how-to-build-a-successful-movement-in-4-steps/)

- "New power operates like a current. It is made by many. It is open, participatory and peer-driven. Like water or electricity, itâ€™s more forceful when it surges. **The goal with new power is not to hoard it but to channel it**."
- Find connected connectors
- Be frictionless; everyone else is also veying for attention and resource commitment
- Move people up the participation scale; keep them engaged
  - Complying
  - Consuming
  - Sharing
  - Affliating
  - Adapting
  - Funding
  - Producing
  - Shaping
