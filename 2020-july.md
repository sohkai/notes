- Forces of human world:
  - Culture (least legible, but most powerful)
  - Politics
  - War
  - Business (most legible, but least powerful)
- "There is no meaningful way for a businessman from (say) 2000 BC to comprehend what Mark Zuckerberg does, let alone take over for him"
- Corporate form existed from 1600 to 1800 in the backdrop of mercantilism (organized around *space*, e.g. land and trade routes)
  - East India Company (EIC) balanced trade between West and East (trade history up to then had always been West importing more than East)
  - Successful in marketing but not innovation
- Only after 1800 did technology play a large part (industrial revolution) (organized around *time*)
  - Productive growth: not zero sum!
  - "The Schumpeterian corporation was about colonizing individual minds"
  - Sailing was a craft; railroads were an engineering discipline (reliable and efficient)
  - "Move humans at the speed of technology instead of moving technology at the speed of humans"
